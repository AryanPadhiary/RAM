# RAM
Single-port RAM provides access through one port, allowing either a read or write operation in one clock cycle. Dual-port RAM features two independent ports, enabling simultaneous reads and writes or concurrent access by two different sources, enhancing performance and flexibility in handling multiple data streams efficiently.
